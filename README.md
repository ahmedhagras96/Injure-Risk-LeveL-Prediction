# Injure-Risk-LeveL-Prediction
**My target from these project it's design a safety system for current construction work depend on predict the injury risk for current specific 
work depending on primary cause so I can care about these cause and be sure 100% it will not happen in my safety system design if the injury risk 
for these cause in my current condition is high, not mush care or less caring if it medium and lowest caring if it low**

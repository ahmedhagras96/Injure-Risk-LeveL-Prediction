# Injure-Risk-LeveL-Prediction
#### [project website](https://injure-risk-level.herokuapp.com/)
## Discription
**Injure-Risk-LeveL-Prediction project is a website we can use it to predict the injure risk of specific risk in constuction site under certain condition so we can handle condition and make proper safety system to it**

## Content
**The project build upon 1897 data rows for different construction site conditions.these data used as train data for our prdiction model .Then we can design a safety system depend on predict the injury risk for current specific work and primary cause so I can care about these cause and be sure 100% it will not happen in my safety system design if the injury risk for these cause in my current condition is high, not mush care or less caring if it medium and lowest caring if it low**

## Inspiration
**I filtered model to most effected factors like Division,Type of Activity,Observation Category..etc.then used the KNeighborsClassifier method to build prdiction model
.Finally useing confusion matrix and accurcy score to measur the accurcy of my prdiction model and the best score i get is .72**

## About the files
**The attached files contain**\
1-The notebook I used to build my model (Injure-Risk-LeveL-Prediction-Model.ipynb).\
2-The uploaded application file to heroku platform (application)\
3-data set we used to design our model (Proactive Data.csv)\
4-other files used in model design,build and deployment
